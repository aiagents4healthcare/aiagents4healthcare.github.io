  <h3>AI Agents for Healthcare Workshop</h3>

  <p>
  This workshop explores the cutting-edge intersection of AI agents and healthcare, focusing on the critical challenges
  and opportunities in developing and deploying intelligent systems capable of autonomous, robust, and ethical operation
  within complex clinical environments. While sophisticated AI agents promise to revolutionize patient care, diagnostics,
  research, and administration, significant hurdles in long-term memory and planning, grounded interaction, clinical
  reasoning, ethical alignment, multi-agent collaboration, tool use, robustness, personalization, multi-modality, and
  trustworthy evaluation persist.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI in healthcare has advanced rapidly, with AI agents—systems capable of autonomous action, planning, and
    interaction—gaining prominence for complex, multi-step tasks and continual learning.
    Foundational works are outlining agent frameworks for healthcare.
    Yet, current agent capabilities often fall short of healthcare’s complex, high-stakes demands.
    The key challenges detailed below, spanning fundamental AI capabilities (memory, reasoning) to system-level concerns
    (multi-agent cooperation, tool use) and ethics/robustness/evaluation, represent critical research frontiers.
    This workshop will focus on addressing these critical research gaps:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Memory &amp; Continual Adaptation</strong> — maintain privacy-safe longitudinal memory, learn online from
      clinician feedback, and preserve a consistent persona across chronic care.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Grounded, Multi-modal &amp; Interactive Agents</strong> — ensure robust grounding across text, imaging, and
      sensor data while sustaining culturally appropriate, coherent dialogue over long encounters.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Clinical Reasoning &amp; Domain-specific Autonomy</strong> — achieve generalizable diagnostic reasoning
      under uncertainty, with privacy-preserving data access and clearly bounded autonomous actions that escalate safely
      to humans.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Alignment, Values &amp; Ethical Decision-making</strong> — align agents’ objectives with stakeholder values
      and moral trade-offs in real-time, open-ended tasks with resource constraints.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Robustness, Global Generalization &amp; Trustworthy Evaluation</strong> — develop agents and evaluation
      protocols that surface failures when systems are deployed beyond Western tertiary-care settings and majority-group
      datasets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tool Use, Real-world Actuation &amp; Multi-agent Collaboration</strong> — provide formal mechanisms for safe
      and well-coordinated multi-agent collaboration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Human–AI Collaboration and Workflow Integration</strong> — enable transparent hand-offs, explainable
      reasoning, and participatory development that fosters clinician and patient trust.
    </li>
  </ol>
